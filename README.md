**Token-Based Path Allocation Approach for Mobile Robots in Sorting Centre**

As the trend of online shopping and e-commerce rapidly rises, warehouses and sorting centers face the challenge of managing an enormous volume of parcels daily. To meet these demands, companies are transitioning to automation, employing Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR) to efficiently sort and deliver parcels in indoor environments. However, with the increasing number of robots in use, avoiding collision and deadlock while executing delivery tasks becomes crucial. This project introduce the concept of “tokens”, which represent the passes that robots need to obtain to access path cells. The project propose a new approach capable of managing multiple robots simultaneously on a large scale while minimizing traffic congestion through strategic token allocation. This project proposed path-finding algorithm utilizes token-based path access and introduces mechanisms for forming and breaking clusters of robots moving in the same direction. These mechanisms reduce the necessity for these robots to slow down while preventing starvation issues of other robots.
